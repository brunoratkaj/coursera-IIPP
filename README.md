IIPP part 1:

Week 4: Stopwatch - project focuses on combining text drawing in the canvas with timers to build a simple digital stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second

Week 5: Pong - in this project Pong arcade video game is made. The motion, collisions and velocity control had to be implemented as well as visualisation.

IIPP part 2:

Week 1: Memory - implementing Memory card game. Emphasis on usage of list methods and visualizing iteration.

Week 2: Blackjack - implementing Blackjack card game. Emphasis on Object-oriented Programming and visualizing objects.

Week 3: Spaceship - implementing a 2D space game (working spaceship plus add a single asteroid and a single missile). Emphasis on Object-                     oriented Programming, implementing acceleration and friction.

Week 4: RiceRocks (Asteroids) - updated version of Spaceship with multiple asteroids and missiles and keeping track of the score. Emphasis                                 on collisions.

For most of the projects a program template was recieved. The main goal was to implement functionality of the task.
